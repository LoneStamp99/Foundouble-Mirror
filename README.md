Python script to find and delete duplicate images

This Python script finds and deletes duplicate images in a given directory. It uses a hash function to generate a unique hash for each image, and then compares the hashes of all images to find duplicates. Any images with the same hash are considered to be duplicates, and one of them is deleted.

The script is very efficient and can handle large collections of images quickly. It can also find duplicate images that have been resized, cropped, or edited.

## Usage

1. Clone the Git repository:
    ```shell
       pip install open-interpreter
    ```
2. Install the required Python packages | Ruby not necessary:
   ```shell
       pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   ```shell
       bundle install
    ```
4. Run the image duplicate scanner:
    * Windows: start.bat
    * Mac/Linux: start.sh
    * Ruby type <strong>Start</strong> & enter
5. Add the folder path that you want to scan for duplicate images.
6. The image duplicate scanner will scan the selected folders and find all duplicate images.
7. Once the scan is complete, you can review the results and delete the duplicate images, if desired.
