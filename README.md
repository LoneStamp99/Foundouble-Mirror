Python script to find and delete duplicate images

This Python script finds and deletes duplicate images in a given directory. It uses a hash function to generate a unique hash for each image, and then compares the hashes of all images to find duplicates. Any images with the same hash are considered to be duplicates, and one of them is deleted.

The script is very efficient and can handle large collections of images quickly. It can also find duplicate images that have been resized, cropped, or edited.
