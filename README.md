Python script to find and delete duplicate images

This Python script finds and deletes duplicate images in a given directory. It uses a hash function to generate a unique hash for each image, and then compares the hashes of all images to find duplicates. Any images with the same hash are considered to be duplicates, and one of them is deleted.

The script is very efficient and can handle large collections of images quickly. It can also find duplicate images that have been resized, cropped, or edited.

## Usage

1. Clone the Git repository:
    <a href="https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/image-duplicate-scanner.git" onclick="copyText()">git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/image-duplicate-scanner.git</a>
<script>
function copyText() {
  var text = document.getElementById("myLink").getAttribute("href");
  navigator.clipboard.writeText(text);
}
</script>
2. Install the required Python packages:
    * pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the image duplicate scanner:
    * Windows: start.bat
    * Mac/Linux: start.sh
4. Select the folders that you want to scan for duplicate images.
5. Click the "Start Scan" button.
6. The image duplicate scanner will scan the selected folders and find all duplicate images.
7. Once the scan is complete, you can review the results and delete the duplicate images, if desired.
  navigator.clipboard.writeText(text);
}
</script>
